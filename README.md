# Airmail2Message PopClip Extension

## Overview

The Airmail2Message PopClip Extension is designed to address the limitations of Airmail's URL support and provide a seamless workflow between Airmail and Apple Mail. Airmail, while a "great" email client, lacks robust development and has issues with its URL handling and AppleScript support.

This extension aims to bridge the gap by converting Airmail URLs (`airmail://message`) into equivalent Apple Mail URLs (`message://`) and opening them in Apple Mail. By using this extension, you can easily open Airmail messages in Apple Mail with a simple click.

## Workflow

1. Select an Airmail URL (`airmail://message`) in any text editor or application.
2. PopClip, a handy macOS utility, will detect the selected URL.
3. Choose the Airmail2Message option from the PopClip menu.
4. The extension will convert the Airmail URL into a corresponding Apple Mail URL (`message://`).
5. The converted URL will automatically open in Apple Mail, displaying the selected email.

## Prerequisites

- PopClip: Ensure that you have PopClip installed on your macOS system. PopClip enhances your productivity by providing context-sensitive actions for selected text.
- Airmail: You may have dumped it and have airmail: URLs lying around you don't know what to do with.
- Mail: You'll need the Apple Mail program as well, having downloaded the same emails that were downloaded by Airmail.

## Installation

1. Download the Airmail2Message.popclipext.zip file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-github-repo-link).
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Double-click the Airmail2Message.popclipext file to install the extension.
4. PopClip will show a notification confirming the successful installation.

## Usage

1. Select an Airmail URL (`airmail://message`) in any application.
2. When the PopClip menu appears, choose the Airmail2Message option.
3. The extension will convert the Airmail URL into an Apple Mail URL (`message://`).
4. Apple Mail will automatically open, displaying the selected email.

## Future Plans

In the future, the developer aims to create a lightweight macOS app that can handle Airmail URLs and directly open them in Apple Mail. This app will serve as a headless solution, further improving the integration between Airmail and Apple Mail.
